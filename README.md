# CodeRetrX: Code Analysis and Semantic Retrieval Library with Smart Strategies 

An AI-powered code analysis library that combines **static analysis** with **LLM-based code retrieval strategies** to perform intelligent code search.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

CodeRetrX processes repositories through a multi-stage pipeline: **Static Analysis** ‚Üí **Code Retrieval** (**Coarse Filter** ‚Üí **Refined Filter**)

### üìù Static Analysis 

Static analysis extracts metadata, including file structures, dependencies, symbols (e.g., classes, functions), and other relevant details. The results of static analysis serve as the foundation for code retrieval and can also be utilized independently for tasks like repository exploration and visualization.

#### Core processes

- **Code Parsing**: Uses tree-sitter to parse source code into abstract syntax trees across 9 programming languages
- **Symbol Extraction**: Extracts functions, classes with hierarchical relationships and dependency
- **Content Structuring**: Breaks code into semantic chunks (definitions, references, imports) with keyword extraction
- **Search Infrastructure**: Integrates ripgrep for fast pattern matching and prepares data for vector similarity search

### üéØ Code Retrieval 

The code retrieval process operates in two stages filtering: prioritizes high recall in the coarse stage (retrieving as many relevant code snippets as possible at minimal cost) and high precision in the refined stage (eliminating false positives), ensuring effective code analysis and security research.

#### Coarse Filter Stage

The coarse filter focuses on maximizing recall while keeping costs low, aiming to retrieve as many potentially relevant code snippets as possible. This stage prioritizes recall over precision, allowing for false positives to ensure comprehensive coverage. Techniques such as vector-based retrieval, LLM-driven semantic analysis, and adaptive algorithms are employed to achieve efficient, large-scale filtering.

#### Refined Filter Stage

The refined filter targets precision by removing the false positives introduced in the coarse stage. It applies a high-precision, strict-validation strategy to isolate truly relevant code snippets. This is achieved through advanced LLM-based semantic analysis with stricter filtering criteria, combined with optional secondary validation using enhanced models to re-evaluate and refine the results from the coarse stage.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Programmatic API

CodeRetrX provides a powerful programmatic interface through the `coderetrx_filter` and `llm_traversal_filter` API, which enables flexible code analysis and retrieval across different search strategies and filtering modes.

The core API combines multiple search strategies with two-stage filtering to balance recall and precision:

#### Using coderetrx_filter (Fast & Efficient)

The `coderetrx_filter` function provides fast, efficient code retrieval with configurable search strategies:

```python
from coderetrx.retrieval import coderetrx_filter
from coderetrx.impl.default import CodebaseFactory

# Initialize codebase
codebase = CodebaseFactory.new("repo_name", "/path/to/your/repo")

# Basic symbol search
elements, llm_results = await coderetrx_filter(
    codebase=codebase,
    prompt="your_filter_prompt",
    subdirs_or_files=["src/"],
    granularity="symbol_content",
    coarse_recall_strategy="symbol"
)

# Process results
for element in elements:
    print(f"Found: {element.name} in {element.file.path}")
```

**Advanced Configuration with coderetrx_filter:**

```python
from coderetrx.retrieval import coderetrx_filter
from coderetrx.retrieval.code_recall import CodeRecallSettings

# Configure advanced settings
settings = CodeRecallSettings(
    llm_primary_recall_model_id="google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17",
    llm_secondary_recall_model_id="openai/gpt-4.1-mini"
)

# Cost-efficient and complete search with line mode and secondary recall
elements, llm_results = await coderetrx_filter(
    codebase=codebase,
    prompt="your_filter_prompt", 
    subdirs_or_files=["src/", "lib/"],
    granularity="symbol_content",
    coarse_recall_strategy="line",
    settings=settings,
    enable_secondary_recall=True
)
```

#### Using llm_traversal_filter (Ground Truth & Maximum Accuracy)

The `llm_traversal_filter` function provides the most comprehensive and accurate analysis, ideal for establishing ground truth:

```python
from coderetrx.retrieval import llm_traversal_filter

# Ground truth search - most comprehensive and accurate
elements, llm_results = await llm_traversal_filter(
    codebase=codebase,
    prompt="your_filter_prompt",
    subdirs_or_files=["src/", "lib/"],
    granularity="symbol_content",
    settings=settings
)
```


#### Search Strategies

**coderetrx_filter** supports `filename`, `symbol`, `line`, and `auto` strategies for different speed/accuracy tradeoffs. **llm_traversal_filter** uses full LLM processing for maximum accuracy.

[See detailed strategy comparison](#-coarse-recall-strategies)

#### Granularity Options

Granularity defines the retrieval target, determining the type of code object to be recalled and returned. For example, if the granularity is set to class_content, the result will include the full content of the relevant classes. Below are the available granularity options:

- **`symbol_content`**: Symbol code content (functions, classes, dependencies)
- **`class_content`**: Class code content  
- **`function_content`**: Function code content  
- **`dependency_name`**: Dependency names  

#### Settings Configuration

The `CodeRecallSettings` class allows fine-tuning of the search behavior:

```python
settings = CodeRecallSettings(
    llm_primary_recall_model_id="...",      # Model used for coarse recall and the primary recall in the refined stage.
    llm_secondary_recall_model_id="...",    # Model used for secondary recall in the refined stage. If set (not None), secondary recall will be enabled.
    llm_selector_strategy_model_id="...",   # Model used for strategy selection in "auto" mode during the coarse recall stage.
    llm_call_mode="function_call"           # LLM call mode. If set to "function_call", the LLM will return results as a function call (recommended for models supporting this feature). 
                                             # If set to "traditional", the LLM will return results in plain text format.
)
```

#### Working with Results

```python
# Process different types of results
for element in elements:
    if hasattr(element, 'name'):  # Symbol
        print(f"Symbol: {element.name} in {element.file.path}")
        print(f"Content: {element.chunk.content}")
    elif hasattr(element, 'path'):  # File
        print(f"File: {element.path}")
    elif hasattr(element, 'text'):  # Keyword
        print(f"Keyword: {element.text}")
        
# Access LLM analysis results
for result in llm_results:
    print(f"Analysis: {result.analysis}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
```

## üîç Coarse Recall Strategies 

In the coarse recall stage, multiple strategies are used to efficiently retrieve potentially relevant code snippets at low cost. The retrieved results will then be further processed in the refined filter stage to improve precision and accuracy.

### Available Strategies 

- **`filename`**: The fastest filtering strategy, ideal for coarse recall by directly determining relevance based on filenames. This approach is highly effective for cases where the query can be matched through filenames alone, such as "retrieve all configuration files." Its simplicity makes it extremely efficient for structural queries and file discovery.

- **`symbol`**: A balanced filtering approach that focuses on symbol names (e.g., function or class names) during coarse recall. This method excels in cases like "retrieve functions implementing cryptographic algorithms," where relevance can be inferred directly from the symbol name. It balances recall and precision for targeted queries at the symbol level.

- **`line`**: A high-accuracy filtering strategy that leverages line-level vector search combined with LLM analysis. It identifies relevance by focusing on the most relevant code lines (`top-k`) within a function body. This method is particularly effective for complex cases where understanding the function‚Äôs implementation is necessary, such as "retrieve code implementing authentication logic." While powerful, it‚Äôs also versatile enough to handle most queries effectively. Our benchmarking shows that the algorithm achieves over 80% recall with approximately 20% of the computational cost, making it both precise and efficient.

- **`auto`**: Automatically selects the optimal filtering strategy based on query complexity, routing requests to the most appropriate method. For the majority of cases, `line` is a well-balanced and reliable choice, but `filename` or `symbol` can also be explicitly used for scenarios where they excel.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Speed**: `filename` > `symbol` > `auto` > `line` > `precise`
- **Accuracy**: `precise` > `line` > `auto` > `symbol` > `filename`
- **Cost**: `filename` < `line` < `auto` < `symbol` < `precise`

Use `filename` for structural queries, `symbol` for API search, `line` for specific code related analysis, `auto` for general purpose, and `precise` for ground truth.
